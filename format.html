        <h3>Formatting</h3>
        <p>We can format our webpage using various elements recognized in html. 
            You can try out a few of them and see how it works. For example this  <b> text is bold</b>
            yet <strong>this is strong.</strong> The text here is <i>however in itallics.</i>
